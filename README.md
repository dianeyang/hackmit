###Winner of the Synaptics, Inc. Prize for Most Innovative Use of Hover

A HackMIT project by Ray Qian, [Winnie Wu](www.twitter.com/thewinniewu), [Diane Yang](www.twitter.com/diane_xy), and Alex Pong.

This is a camera app for the Samsung Galaxy S4 that aims to make it easier to capture photos and videos. By taking advantage of the S4's hover events to control focusing, users can avoid hunting and pecking to set auto focus points when taking photos. When taking video, users avoid camera shake from tapping to refocus the screen in certain areas. In addition, we have also incorporated swipes to switch between video and still mode.
