###Winner of the Synaptics, Inc. Prize for Most Innovative Use of Hover

This was a HackMIT Fall 2013 project. This app aims to make taking pictures and video more intuitive. By using the Samsung Galaxy S4's hover events to control focusing, users can avoid hunting and pecking to set auto focus points when taking photos. When taking video, users avoid camera shake from tapping to refocus the screen in certain areas. In addition, we have also incorporated swipes to switch between video and still mode.
